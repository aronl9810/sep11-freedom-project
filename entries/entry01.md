## Lets do this! 11/07/2022

Hello everyone! All entries beyond this point will demonstate this project that has followed me through SEP10 all the way to SEP11. With that, lets begin.

After the last expo, I gained a lot of inspiration from the other winners. One of which was Ryan's stand and shoot game. He managed to create a zombie shooting game using A-frame. Seeing how his inspriation came from a lot of zombie shooting games such as Left 4 Dead, I felt connected. I have played Left 4 Dead as well as speedrunning it for a bit of fun. During this day forward, I wanted to make my own game that I want to present to the expo next time. 

Fast forward to junior year, I am in SEP11. This unit, we are learning about javascript. Compared to the last freedom project, we have a lot more freedom compared to the last freedom project where we have to make a website on our invention. We can now create games using javascript using tools such as Kaboom and Melon. I wanted to create a game also but I want to challenge myself further. There is a reason why I want to do this. Its because I want to not lose motivation and the harder the challenge is, the more I want to invest my time to it.

I had a interesting idea in mind. One of which was making a Friday Night Funkin Mod. I initally treated it as a funny joke to my friends and it once actually appeared in my dreams funny enough. Later on, I actually want to make a Friday Night Funkin mod. It was initally skeptical and scared at first ; seeing how some things looks complicated and I have to learn another programming language. It was not until the Nonsense Mod Creater made a [video](https://youtu.be/bUj0KODb8BA) on how he made his own mod WITHOUT any modding experience. This boosted my confidence into making this project work. If he can make a mod without any experience, so can I.

Once I got permission to do this project, I got straight to work. I needed an engine that is simple enough for me to work on. Thankfully, PsychEngine does the job. All of the intergrations of PsychEngine are made simpiler. All you need to do is adding scripts that make your mod interesting compared to the rest.
