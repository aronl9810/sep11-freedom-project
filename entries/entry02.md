Getting to know the Psych Engine 12/17/2022

So I'm at the point of tynkering with Psych Engine. I learned quite a bit and I want to share my experience with you.

After following a [psych engine tutorial](https://youtu.be/qxMyoudrFPs) made by BB--panzu. I learned how many things work around psych engine. I decided that I don't mess around with the sprite sheet yet since I don't have the material to tynker with that yet. I am planning to [collab](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) with Dice to make a character and converting it into a sprite sheet. 

I want to talk about 2 parts of what I experienced so far. The chart editor and the song. 

## The song

The song is pretty interesting. It is split up into 2 parts. The instrument and the vocals.

The intrument is explanatory. It is the instrumental of the song and the vocals are the voices are the songs. The reason why they are seperated is because if the player misses a note, then the vocals will be cut off for a split second. 

Now for my tynkering, I decided to use [jummbox](https://jummbus.bitbucket.io) for my testing for my instrumental. This was recommended by the Friday Night Funkin Modding Community for beginners. 

For the vocals, I decided to use a random sound effect as I haven't watched the tutorial on making vocals yet. I am planning to use this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/pc8c-A0AJX4) I found by doing some [research](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills).
