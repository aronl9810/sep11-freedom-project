# Entry 4
## Lets make some music shall we 3/14/2023

After entry 3, I decided to make the instrumentals before I move on to the vocals of my music. Since I'm on my MVP stage of my project, one song is enough before I move on to something more insane like an entire week consisting of 3 songs.

So far, I have been trying to make the instruments good sound as possible while keeping the songs 4/8/16 bars long for consistancy. There is a reason why it has to be this way since most FNF songs need to take half the amount for the vocals on your opponent and you as well. Having a odd amount of bars will lead to bad sounding vocals that will sound very off from the instrumental.

You can see that when I reach my desired bar limit, I change part of the song. This is to prevent the music from sounding repetitive. This is a part of [Music theory](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills), a skill that I am trying to be good at. Music theory allows me to understand what instruments fit well with the current piece I'm trying to create as well as how it teaches me how music is written as a whole.

While working on my music, I was also getting [better at using Ableton](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills). When I was creating and learning about music theory, I felt like Ableton was basically second nature to me. Knowing how a software works can be crutial as it can shift how well you can do since you are basically at the programs mercy to give you something easy to learn.
