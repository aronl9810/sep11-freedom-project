## Sprites and Code. Two in one combo! 4/17/2023

With music finished, I got to the coding part of my freedom project. Now you may be asking. "But Aron, didn't you say that you are also gonna work on the sprites on the game? Why are you talking about coding now?". Great question fellow reader! There is a unique skill called [Collaboration](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) and [Commication](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills). 

Dice is a fellow SEP member as well as a digital artist. She was the perfect candidate to ask for help. She gladly accepted to create the sprites for me. Although I could make the sprites myself, her art style surpassed me. You can just see the difference between my art style versus hers later on.

That being said, I need to also provide a character sheet to her so that is what exactly what I did. I made the base character sheet to give Dice a reference to draw. Here is what the character sheet looked like.

Once I sent this to Dice, I made a reasonable deadline for Dice so that she doesn't need to feel pressured into rushing. This is something I need to take into consideration. I need to make a deadline that is long enough so that the person helping doesn't feel rushed doing this while also not making it last minute.
